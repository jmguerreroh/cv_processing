# Computer Vision Examples

[![humble](https://github.com/jmguerreroh/computer_vision/actions/workflows/master.yaml/badge.svg?branch=humble)](https://github.com/jmguerreroh/computer_vision/actions/workflows/master.yaml)

This project contains code examples created in Visual Studio Code for Computer Vision using C++ & OpenCV & Point Cloud Library (PCL) in ROS2. These examples are created for the Computer Vision Subject of Robotics Software Engineering Degree at URJC.

This package is recommended to use with the [IR_ROBOTS](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/ir_robots.git) simulator.

# Run

Execute:
```bash
ros2 launch computer_vision cv.launch.py
```
If you want to use your own robot, in the launcher, change the topic names `camera_image`, and `camera_pointcloud` to match the robot topics.
